# Tutorial Introduction

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Tutorial

Welcome everyone to this tutorial. Through this tutorial, you will learn how to systematically develop a DAPP (decentralized application), which in this tutorial is a blockchain game. To better study and complete this project, you should have some understanding of Solidity, terminal usage, JavaScript, and React.js. The remaining knowledge will be acquired in the upcoming lessons.

## ðŸŽ® What Are We Doing

Since the birth of the first blockchain game, CryptoKitties, in 2017, the popularity of blockchain games has been enduring. Subsequently, games like Axie Infinity, StarShark, and others have become explosively popular.

This tutorial aims to help traditional internet developers step into Web3.0 and develop their own blockchain game.
